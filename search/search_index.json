Some examples include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A generic virtual machine module that abstracts away commonly used parameters into variables such as: </p> <ul> <li>TeamId: sets <code>guestinfo.teamId</code> in <code>extra_config</code>.</li> <li>Networks: creates a NIC for each specified network and assigns it to the specified network vlan.</li> <li>ExerciseId: appends the <code>exerciseId</code> to the name of the vm for use with ODX's where unique naming is required.</li> <li>Other simplified variable names based on the target audience.</li> <li>A module to create a very specific type of virtual machine resource, such as a domain controller, that points to a known good VMware template/base disk and an Ansible playbook that requires variables such as:</li> <li>Domain Name</li> <li>IP Address</li> <li>DomainAdminUser</li> <li>DomainAdminPass</li> <li>A module to define an entire Cyber Flag enclave.</li> <li>A module to define a generic GreySpace that accepts variables to configure GreyBox, TopGen, etc.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Modules allow for endless flexibility for developers to wrap whatever configuration they can create into a small package and describe to consumers of the module exactly what it does and what values it requires to function. </p> <p>Caster makes it easier to search for and use modules when building a Terraform configuration. </p> <p>Caster supports modules created as GitLab projects that are visible to the GitLabToken defined in the API settings with at least one version defined.  All versions will be shown in Caster when the project is added/refreshed to Caster.  </p> <p>Note:  Caster requires that the inputs file and the outputs file be written in JSON (that is, <code>variables.tf.json</code> and <code>ouptuts.tf.json</code>). </p> <p>There are three ways that the a module can be added/refreshed to Caster:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Every time that the modules list is requested, Caster API checks for updated modules in the Terraform-Modules group (the group ID is a Caster API setting) or any of its sub-groups.

That is, Destroy creates a plan that will destroy all of the previously deployed resources in a workspace.</p> <p>Note: If a resource is defined in the configuration and created in a run and then deleted from the configuration, it is destroyed upon the next plan or destroy run. This is because a Terraform run always tries to match the infrastructure to the current configuration. </p> <p>Note: Only one run can be in progress at a time per workspace. Terraform locks the state of the workspace and only a single operation can be performed at a time. Developers may wish to break up large deployments into multiple directories and workspaces to operate on different parts of the deployments simultaneously.  For example: User enclaves may be broken out so developers can perform actions on other parts of a network without (potentially) waiting a long time to redeploy user machines.</p> <p>The workspace view allows users to see a table with all the runs that have been planned and applied within that directory. Runs highlighted in red are destroyed operations.</p> <p>Within the workspace view users can click <code>Destroy</code> to destroy live Terraform applications.</p> <p>This infrastructure as code approach is different than many developers may be used to. The general approach here is to define a configuration and apply it in its entirety, rather than selecting individual pieces to be deployed. There are some ways to target individual pieces of a configuration, but they are recommended by Terraform to be the exception rather than the rule and are not yet fully implemented in Caster.</p> <p>Taint</p> <p>Taint is a flag on a resource that tells Terraform to destroy and recreate a new instance on the next plan-and-apply cycle.</p> <p>Taint allows users to redeploy resources.

A permission can be assigned to a user or a team. Some permissions such as <code>SystemAdmin</code> are read-only. <code>ExerciseAdmin</code> and <code>SystemAdmin</code> are permanent permissions that cannot be edited or deleted.</p> <p>Role: A set of permissions that can be grouped together and assigned to a user or team.</p> <p>Team: A group of logged in users who are associated with a view. Each team can be configured to view a particular set of applications and be granted team-level roles/permissions.</p> <p>User: A user who is identified in an Identity Server configured for the Player system is automatically added into Player upon the first login. In addition, users can be pre-loaded into Player using the Player API.</p> <p>Note: IdentityServer4 is an OAuth 2.0 framework that is used by the Software Engineering Institute to authenticate users. Some Identity servers are configured to authenticate using CAC cards while others are user/password based - depending upon the location of the system.</p> <p>View: These are the settings associated with building a view.
